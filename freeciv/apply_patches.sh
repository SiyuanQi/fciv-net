# Freeciv server version upgrade notes (backports)
# ------------------------------------------------
# osdn #????? is ticket in freeciv.org tracker:
# https://osdn.net/projects/freeciv/ticket/?????
#
# 0053-Add-MAX_CITY_TILES-to-fc_types.h.patch
#   Make MAX_CITY_TILES definition available for the network protocol
#   osdn #45886
# 0051-Make-vision-site-name-allocation-dynamic.patch
#   Do not reserve memory for every city name by the longest possible,
#   FoW part.
#   osdn #45844
# 0024-Mark-server-to-web-client-packets-no-handle.patch
#   Ease maintenance of regular clients when web-packets change
#   osdn #45955

# Not in the upstream Freeciv server
# ----------------------------------
# meson_webperimental installs webperimental ruleset
# freeciv_segfauls_fix is a workaround some segfaults in the Freeciv server. Freeciv bug #23884.
# message_escape is a patch for protecting against script injection in the message texts.
# tutorial_ruleset changes the ruleset of the tutorial to one supported by Freeciv-web.
#      - This should be replaced by modification of the tutorial scenario that allows it to
#        work with multiple rulesets (Requires patch #7362 / SVN r33159)
# win_chance includes 'Chance to win' in Freeciv-web map tile popup.
# disable_global_warming is Freeciv bug #24418
# navajo-remove-long-city-names is a quick-fix to remove city names which would be longer than MAX_LEN_NAME
#     when the name is url encoded in json protocol.
#     MAX_LEN_CITYNAME was increased in patch #7305 (SVN r33048)
#     Giving one of the longer removed city names to a new city still causes problems.
# load_command_confirmation adds a log message which confirms that loading is complete, so that Freeciv-web can issue additional commands.
# endgame-mapimg is used to generate a mapimg at endgame for hall of fame.
